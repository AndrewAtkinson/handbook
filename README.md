Issue Labels
------------

We use the following labels:

 * <a name="label_bug"></a>`bug`: falasdasd 




Development Process
-------------------

Our development process is based on Scrum, but modified slightly to apply better to our specific needs:
 * we don't do customer projects, we are our own Product Owners
 * we don't want to use additional tools other than GitHub Issues which we already use

The rough outline goes like so: Everyone creates issues in various repositories. The issues are labeled as `bug`, `cleanup` and `feature`. @dmurko, who acts as a Product Owner and the current Scrum Master (we iterate between @karantan and @dz0ny), along with the issue author, create User Stories from these issues. What this means is that they create an 

 and put them on the Product Backlog. At sprint planning meeting we decide which User Stories from the Product Backlog we include in the sprint.

Our Product Backlog only includes the top part of the official Scrum Product Backlog -- the well defined, ready to be worked on, User Stories.

If we need to fix an urgent bug, we use the Scrum Priority Lane approach. This means that the User Story still needs to get written and if the Product Owner decides it really is urgent, the User Story is added to the top of WIP column and labeled with [Priority Lane] so that everyone knows this is exceptional and the whole team needs to focus on getting this User Story to Done ASAP.


We also have ongoing label for ongoing tasks. These tasks do not get included in sprints, but we acknowledge them by decreasing our sprint story points limit.
