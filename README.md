---

For the last decade, we have been accumulating knowledge and practicalities of running an Open Source business inside our walled-off intranet. At the 10th Anniversary Party we realized it is time that we make these public and potentially help people in similar positions.

The Handbook offers us an opportunity to clarify what Niteo is and how we function. It allows greater transparency to our partners, potential new team members and the wider Open Source community.

Please do help keep these documents up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and role changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. You don't like a specific thing about how we work? Please submit a Pull Request with a proposal of how we can do better.

If you’re reading this just after joining Niteo, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with Niteo for long years to spot our broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.
