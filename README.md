# The Niteo Handbook

For the last decade, we have been accumulating knowledge and practicalities of running an Open Source business inside our walled-off intranet. At the 10th Anniversary Party we realized it is time that we make these public and potentially help people in similar positions.

The Handbook offers us an opportunity to clarify what Niteo is and how we operate. It allows greater transparency to our partners, potential new team members, and the wider Open Source community.

Please help us keep these documents up to date! This doesn't mean just typos and broken links, but also to reflect the latest changes in our work processes. And if there's something you don't like in how we work, open an Issue and let's discuss better solutions.

This goes especially for new people joining Niteo. It's harder for us who've been stuck in our broken ways for years to see the obvious. Take advantage of being new and question things and show us how to do better.

This Handbook is always Work-In-Progress. Please update it by creating a new Pull Request with the proposed changes or [open an Issue](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/issues) for discussion.
