# Work Process

Our work process is based on Scrum, but modified slightly to apply better to our specific needs:
 * we don't do customer projects, we are our own Product Owners,
 * we don't want to use additional tools other than GitHub Issues which we already use.

The rough outline goes like so: Everyone creates issues in various repos. The issues are labeled as [Bug](#label_bug), [Cleanup](#label_cleanup), [Feature](#label_feature) and [Marketing](#label_marketing). @dmurko, who acts as a Product Owner and the current Scrum Master (we iterate between @karantan and @dz0ny), along with the issue author, create User Stories from these issues and put them on our [Product Backlog]((https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/projects/1)). What this means is that they create an issue in the [Operations](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/) repo, enter the required information (we have a [template](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for that) and apply appropriate labels to the new issue:
 * one of [Bug](#label_bug), [Cleanup](#label_cleanup), [Feature](#label_feature) or [Marketing](#label_marketing)
 * one of project labels ([EBN](#label_ebn), [DMON](#label_dmon)) OR if the User Story is not project specific, the [Operations](#label_operations) label
 * [Product Backlog](#label_product_backlog) label

Then they go to our [Kanban Board](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/projects/1) and add the newly created User Story issue to the Product Backlog column.

In other words, our Product Backlog only includes the top part of the official Scrum Product Backlog -- the well defined, ready to be worked on, User Stories. The non-well defined issues are spread around our repositories and can be considered as ideas. Some of these can be labeled with the [Needs User Story](#label_needs_user_story) label so that we are reminded about the importance of these issues and we convert them into proper User Stories under the Operations repo during the [Product Backlog Refinement meeting](#product_backlog_refinement_meeting).


## Urgent production fixes

If we need to fix an urgent bug, we use the Scrum Priority Lane approach: the User Story gets written and then if the Product Owner decides it really is urgent, the User Story is added to the top of WIP column and labeled with [Priority Lane)[#label_priority_lane] so that everyone knows it is an exceptional and urgent issue and the whole team needs to focus on getting it to column Done ASAP.


## Ongoing Tasks

Sometimes the result of the User Story is an agreement that we should do a certain task periodically, over a large span of time. Such tasks are created in whichever repo is the most appropriate and labeled with [Ongoing](#label_ongoing) label.


## Sprint Timeline

Our sprints are two weeks long. They start on a Wednesday 10am CEST with the **Sprint Planning** meeting. They end on a Tuesday two weeks later with **Sprint Review** and **Sprint Retrospective** meetings held at 10am CEST.

On the Wednesday in the middle of the sprint we hold the <a name="product_backlog_refinement_meeting"></a>**Product Backlog Refinement** meeting at 10am CEST.

All other days we hold the Daily Standup meeting at 10am CEST.


## Issue Labels

We use the following labels across all our repos:
 * <a name="label_sanity_check"></a>**Sanity Check**: Results of automatic checks of production data, more on TODO.
 * <a name="label_bug"></a>**Bug**: a user-facing or support-facing annoyance
 * <a name="label_feature"></a>**Feature**: a user-facing or support-facing improvement, addition
 * <a name="label_cleanup"></a>**Cleanup**: something that increases our velocity
 * <a name="label_ongoing"></a>**Ongoing**: long-running tasks, see (Ongoing Tasks)[#ongoing-tasks]
 * <a name="label_support"></a>**Support**: user-facing maintenance work, not included in sprints, such as fixing subscription problems, resetting passwords, re-enabling accounts, etc.
 * <a name="label_needs_user_story"></a>**Needs User Story**: an arbitrary issue in any repo that needs to be converted into a User Story

The following labels are used only in Operations repo to manage the Scrum Board:
 * <a name="label_priority_lane"></a>**Priority Lane**: User Stories injected into the current sprint due to urgency
 * <a name="label_marketing"></a>**Marketing**: a marketing related task, such as setting up ad campaigns, writing blog posts, ...
 * <a name="label_product_backlog"></a>**Product Backlog**: all User Stories that can be considered for inclusion in the next sprint
 * <a name="label_ebn"></a>**EBN**: User Stories for the Easy Blog Networks project
 * <a name="label_dmon"></a>**DMON**: User Stories for the Easy Domain Monitor / Indexation Check project

The following labels are used only in Operations repo for tickets not included in sprints:
 * <a name="label_people"></a>**People**: internally-facing maintenance work, not included in sprints, such as hiring, onboarding, ...
