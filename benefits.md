## Allowances

Your productivity allowance can be used to pay for any expenses that you believe can improve your work. Some examples of such expenses (but definitely not a finite list):

* A new phone, computer or monitor.
* A good microphone and camera for meetings.
* A good work chair or a standing desk.
* Internet connection with a static IP at a reputable provider.
* Attend a conference.
* Membership of a local hackerspace.
* Subscription to an online or offline course.
* A gadget such as a Kindle or a Pebble watch.
* A Raspberry PI to play around with and learn new things.

In other words, would something boost your productivity and creativity? Good, feel free to buy it with your allowance, no questions asked.

### Monthly allowance amount

The current rates as of *February 2017* are:

 * Niteans: _$150_
 * Founders: _$300_

At the beginning of the month, invoice the company with the amount of allowance spent in the previous month. The monthly amounts compound every month, so whatever you do not spend this month, you can use the next month, or the one after.

You can request an increase in your allowance if you feel the current one doesn't cover all the expenses for you. You can spend a few months of future allowance. The maximum allowance balance you can keep is 18 months. That said, it's smart to keep at least a few months allowance, just in case something breaks.

### Software purchasing

Any software or tools that are a requirement for your role at Niteo, e.g. Photoshop for designers, will be a company expense and is separate from your allowance.

  * Personal accounts (e.g. Adobe Cloud): A monthly company expense that Niteo reimburses.
  * Company account with sub-users: Dejan will signup as Niteo and send login details to users.

## Conferences

We encourage you to attend conferences to improve your knowledge of a subject area and network with similar minded people. Try to give notice at least 10-14 days before attending a conference.

All expenses for the conference, such as transport, accommodation, fees, food, etc., are covered by your [allowance](#productivity-allowance) and the additional conference allowance.

### Conference allowance

The conference allowance accounts for all the days you are away at the conference and depends on the amount of travelling and acclimatization required:

* $50/day for local conferences, in or near your home city.
* $200/day for international conferences.
* $300/day for intercontinental conferences.
* Bonus 50%/day if you give a 30-60min talk at the conference.

Conferences count as working days (7.5h per day). Transport to conferences counts too (up to 7.5h per day).

The conference bonus requires that you write a report about the conference when you get back. It can be published on Intra or on any of our blogs. The conference fee amount is reimbursed using your allowance.

For example, Dejan goes to a three-day conference in London:

    * Conference fee is $500.
    * Flights, trains and taxis are $300.
    * Hotel and food are $400.

    Dejan charges the company $1200 in allowances so his conference allowance is calculated as:

    * $1500 (5 * $200/day + $500 for the conference fee)

    Before the trip, Dejan's allowance was $500 in credit and after the trip, it is now $800.


## Courses

We encourage you to take courses by paying for time spent on the course, either online or offline. A rough guideline is one course per quarter. The amount covered is based on how direct the benefit is from the course, based on the course syllabus.

* 50% for loosely work-related courses which do not have an immediate benefit.
* 100% for work-related courses with immediate benefits.

After finishing the course, you should write a short review of the course, for others to use when deciding whether to take a course or not.

The main limitation is that project work always has priority over course-related work.

If you need to pay a fee to participate in the course, use your [allowance](#productivity-allowance).

## Time-off

Main article: [Time-off](time-off.md)

We expect Niteans to take sensible time-off and use their vacation time and public holidays throughout the year. We also understand that everyone gets sick or need family time so allowances are made for these too.


## Severance

While many of us are good friends, we are still a business, not a family. So people join and leave us from time to time and every Nitean (except Trialists) is entitled to a severance package:
  * Up to one year: 1 month base salary,
  * More than one year: 2 months base salary + 1 month for each additional year, up to max 12 months total.

Whenever we have to let someone go, we follow these procedures:

* The person needs to know at least 1 month in advance that their position could be cancelled in the near term.
* The person needs to know that if we will be hiring for the same position again in the future, they will have priority over completely new people.
* All Partners need to agree with cancellation.
* When cancellation is agreed, the person should be notified immediately.
* The person is no longer required to work, but is encouraged to take their time to hand off anything they feel is valuable to other people in Niteo.
