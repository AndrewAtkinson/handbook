# Catchup Meetings

These are short weekly informal meetings (also known as 1-on-1) with a senior team member to "catch up" with you. They're more of a "with a beer in a coffee shop" than a "conference room" meeting. They're here so you can let us know about the work in the last week, give private feedback about the work, working conditions, company, projects, ideas and anything else on your mind. Take it as your time to discuss anything you want.

These meetings are very important for us because we're all working remotely and we have very little idea on what's going outside the standup, few Slack messages and work done. We want to know more about how we can help you work and feel better working with us.

The meeting is not meant for detailed project or task discussions. We have standups, Slack and GitHub for that.

Meetings are once per week, at an agreed scheduled time and they can be on Zoom.us, on phone or in person. The meetings are scheduled for 30 minutes (they can take longer if needed). They are not to be cancelled unless in the case of an emergency.

## Common Things To Discuss

* Feedback for the last week of work. Any blockers we can remove?
* Questions, feedback, ideas or concerns you might have.
* Do you need any help at the moment with your work?
* Do you get enough feedback on your work?
 
* What could we do to make your work easier?
* Do you feel over-worked, under-worked, or just the right workload?
* Do you feel challenged at work? Are you learning new things?
* What part of the day do you have the most energy and focus? What changes could we make to your work schedule to accommodate this?
* What makes you excited and motivated to work on a project?
* Your goals for the future. In what direction do you want to develop your skills?
* What are your plans for the weekend? :)

* What should we be doing and are not?
* What is the #1 Problem at our company? Why?
* Are we doing a good job explaining where we want to go and how we're doing right now?
* Half-baked ideas for projects, the company or anything else.
 
* What will you do till the next meeting?
* What will your senior do till the next meeting?
