# Introduction

Everyone on Support (EOS) is a regular activity wherein all full-time members are called upon to do a Support shift once every month (this includes customer and tech support). Trialists and part-time team members are excluded from this.

EOS is not designed to make everyone Support or to be pulled from regular work to do support. The main reason why we're doing this is that a new set of eyes can help find issues and opportunities in current processes. A developer might see something that is not obvious to a non-dev. A marketer might see a great opportunity that was dismissed till then.

In the end, we are working for our customers, and having everyone involved in the conversation will help improve their experience and make them happy. And happy customers are happy to spend money with us.

# Mechanics

### I. Instructions

* Start by reading our policy on handling support. See [Handling Support Requests](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/support.md).
* Support has a lot of documents for various processes. To Fast-track the onboarding process and get a good grasp of the common issues and tools we're using, start with these three articles:
  * [Support Tools](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/06b3b8a4ed6e458389f3f18c052820cc?_authenticator=4370b6b80703bfc00ae810dd8a4e4b195dad0c70)
  * [Support Issues Checklist](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/27e8d0a469c54508821ca7eb1cb674de?_authenticator=4df577a89bd00d33b550b8ada6cad17d77cc6992)
  * [Dealing With Users](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/fe1828f8656f4538bd621b17b94d0dd0?_authenticator=5bdf9c916b73f016966788aa96c8857374dd61db)
* We use [GrooveHQ](https://niteoweb.groovehq.com/) for handling support emails. For EOS, we have a predefined account which you'll need to personalize when you're on duty. Login credentials are on 1Password under *Team* vault. Go to *Edit Profile page* and update the *Name* field to your personal name and leave the username as is (@niteo). Your name will not be reflected in UI immediately so you need to log out and log back in.
* After logging back in to GrooveHQ, you will see the list of all tickets with assigned agent next to it. You can start working on any of the unassigned ones.
* On the sidebar, you can track list of all tickets assigned to you by clicking on *My New & Open*.
* Everyone has *Staff* access to the EBN app, this allows you to log in to internal *Blog Dashboard* app.
* GrooveHQ integrates with Slack so we get a live stream of emails and responses. You can optionally join #support-emails channel, if you want to follow support operations.
* All support documents can be found in  [Intra EBN folder](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/7847a106ce0f430eb17a266d9991779c?_authenticator=3acbf41de0b77ac8175786d768bd07cc632b3abb). Make sure you go through them regularly and suggest improvements where needed.


### II. Frequency

EOS is once every month. 

Since we're on Sprints, it's expected that Team Capacity will be affected and duly adjusted.

### III. Schedule

Everyone will set their own schedule and keep with it. Set a date and [update the calendar in Intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/8fafd02d2a0544138e89e4cae9e8d880?_authenticator=3f78a24ac01ed12b1a7fe35ffb10d313ce9d5647).
