# How We Manage Documentation

intra.niteoweb.com - General documentation, minutes of meetings, knowledge base
Resilio - Works similar to DropBox, but is much more secure as encrypts all data locally and it does not require a central server. Used for storing operations and projects files, that are being actively used.
JungleDisk - Archive of no-longer-needed operations and projects files. All files can be accessed TTW or via an installable client software.
github.com/niteoweb - Code repository and ticketing system for all our projects. You do not work on something unless a ticket for your task exists.
docs.niteoweb.com - Technical documentation for projects, generated automatically by Sphinx on every code change. Also a ton of books and videos from our past events.
