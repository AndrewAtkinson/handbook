# Find Your Next Task

Most of our work is done through sprints and if you are in one, make sure you're doing those tasks first since they're our focus.

If for some reason you are not in the sprint, be it because of onboarding or because you finished your tasks, follow the steps below.

And, if all is done, you can always read a book, take an online course or just think about how we could make the company better.

# Developers

Go through our [Product Backlog on GitHub](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Product+Backlog%22). Choose a task you like that is not on a sprint and ask the Scrum Master if you can start working on it. Search the codebase and documentation for "TODO", "XXX" and similar strings. Try to understand why it's there and create a ticket for it. If you like the task, you can start working on it immediately. 

## DevOps and Support

First focus is that our systems are running smoothly and that all our customers' issues have been resolved and answered. If that is done, next thing would be to make sure our documents are updated. Read through the [Handbook](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook) and [Intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com/) and review if there are any updated necessary. 

If you are DevOps and have had no tasks for some time, you can join the next sprint.

If you are Support and have had a slow few days, start reading on how we could improve our support. This may include improving our processes or rewriting our responses.

# Marketing

Think about other means of how we could make money. Read blog posts about innovative ways to gain leads and customers.

# Operations

Review our [Handbook](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook) and [Intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com/), update docs as necessary. Ask people what are the current issues they're facing and how we could resolve them.
