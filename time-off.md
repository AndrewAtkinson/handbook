## Vacation

Everyone is entitled to 165 hours of paid vacation time (22 days) in any calendar year.

 * Birth of a child is 20 extra days of paid leave.
 * Death in the family is 3 extra days of paid leave.

These hours will be used to substitute any missing hours when one doesn't fulfill the monthly work quota. The over/undertime hours are automatically calculated every month for the previous month.


### Booking vacation

To book vacation time off, see the Intra [Planned absences](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/dcf71b9c6b17430789ace610c9ac384a) page. Remember to post to `#out-of-office` channel on Slack whenever you add a new entry.


### Unused vacation

Unused vacation hours in a calendar year can be carried over to the next year but must be used by July 1st. If not, we are going to have a serious conversation because everyone needs a break.

### Unpaid vacation

Your profit share will be affected by the number of unpaid vacation time your take. See [Profit sharing](profit-sharing.md) for full details.


## Public holidays

We are from different parts of the World, and we have different customs when it comes to public holidays. The Americans have close to no public holidays, some countries have up to 20 public holidays per year (though some come on weekends). To avoid taking a break when your government tells you to instead of when you *need* a break, and to avoid "bad holiday years" when all public holidays come on weekends and are hence rendered moot, we have our own little approach to holidays:

* Everyone is entitled to one public holiday each month, whichever day they want. This one day is automatically calculated as one working day less every month.


## Sick leave

Everyone has the right to sick leave on days when they don't feel capable of working. Partial work on a sick leave day proportionally reduces the total daily hours to not exceed 7.5 hours. In other words, sick leave hours cannot be used to gain any overtime hours, by the same principle as vacation leave hours cannot be used for that purpose either. Sick leave can and should be used when taking care of an ill child or spouse.

A sick leave day counts as 6 hours of work done. For partially worked sick leave days, we use the following formula:

    Tallied hours = (workday hours - worked sick-day hours ) * 80% + worked sick-day hours

An example for working for 2 hours on a sick day:

    (7.5h - 2h) * 0.8 + 2h = 6.4h
